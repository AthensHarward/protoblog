                <p>These links go to article that I have written. They are short decsriptions of my 
                    opions about the books. I also have supplied information that I thought was interesting. 
                    This was not meant to be an exhaustive site made for academic use. It is merely information and 
                    thoughts that I personally found interesting about the works.
