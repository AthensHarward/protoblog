        <p><b>Short Bio</b><br>
          Born: July 4th, 1804<br>
          Died: May 19th, 1864<br>
          Birthplace: Salem, Massachusetts<br><br>
          Considered to be one the great American authors,
          Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote several novels that remain 
          popular even today. The Scarlet Letter and The House 
          of the Seven Gables being just two examples.
          Growing up in Salem, Hawthorne had a direct ancestor 
          who had been a judge during the Salem witch trials 
          in the town's history. Hawthorne himself mused whether 
          the hardships of his family line since then were the 
          result his ancestors actions. One of the women that 
          had been sentenced to death by his ancestor had 
          purportedly cursed the Hawthorne family. This plays 
          along a similar theme with Pyncheon family curse 
          in The House of the Seven Gables.

        </p>
        <p>Published in 1851, The House of the Seven Gables was modeled after a real house 
          owned by Hawthorne's cousin. The actual house was built in 1668 just 24 years before 
          the Salem witch trials. The history of the house being related to the trials and 
          Hawthorne's own family's role in the event, has left the house as one of the most 
          haunted locations in Salem. The house is still standing today as a museum.

        <p>For the book, I am using the free, public domain ebook from Project Gutenburg. It is an excellent source for 
          ebooks that have entered the public domain. LibriVox is another great source for public domain audiobooks.<br>
          I am also using Audible for when I am running or doing other tasks that prevent me from reading.

        <p><b>Chapter 10</b><br><i>The Pyncheon Garden</i><p>
        <p>Today while walking and listening, Hawthorne gave a lot of space to describing the garden and the chickens. 
        I have had several years experience being around gardens and chickens, so I am very familiar with this kind of setting. 
        Hawthorne's description of the tiniest details and his ability to draw out the most nestalgic parts were 
        absolutely incredible. It was like he was able to distill the essence of these experiences and give the reader 
        the joy of this world.<br>For someone who has never experienced these things or has had bad or limited experiences, this 
        is the perfect way to enter the soul of someone who truly finds peace in these things.</p>
