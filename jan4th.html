        <p>Hello, fellow bipeds.<br>So today I published my first website. I did this with the intention of becoming familiar with web development and what 
            better way than by doing. I stuck with some basic HTML and CSS. My thoughs are that I am going to type out a new article 
            with all new HTML and CSS everytime I blog something. This way I turn the whole development process into a routine.<br>I'm 
            I'm sure it will take several rounds to get this down right, but as it becomes second nature, I will be adding more layers 
            and complexity along the way. This will encourage learning and keep the process interesting.<br>I will try and post my 
            progress on this journey for whoever wants to follow along.
