            <p><b>Intentions</b><br>
                The purpose of these articles is to give basic 
                background information to help with the context 
                of specific events or characters. It is not 
                meant for an exhaustive study.

            <p><b>Common Stereotypes</b><br> 
                I am mostly focused on a broad, 
                bird's eye view of the movement, so I will 
                not be spending much time exploring the truth of 
                sterotypes.<br><br>
                Whether or not people were aware of it or not, 
                two well known roles of the Puritans in history were 
                as the Pilgrims that landed at Plymouth Rock and 
                as the instigators of the Salem Witch Trials. 
                As far as people's opinion of them, both past and 
                present, they are known being extremely prudish and 
                morally strict. In fact, this is where we get the word 
                Puritanical, which references their work ethic  
                in addtion to their disdain of pleasure.
