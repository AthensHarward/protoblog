            <p>The purpose of these articles, is to give a basic 
                overview of background information to aid in 
                understanding the context of specific events or 
                characters. It is not intended for an exhaustive

                I am mostly focused on a broad, 
                bird's eye view of the movement, so I will 
                not be spending much time exploring the truth of 
                sterotypes.<br>*********************************
                
                Some common perceptions of the Puritans are 
                their roles as the Pilgrims that landed at 
                Plymouth Rock and as the instigators of the 
                Salem Witch Trials. They were also very 
                well known for extremely strict and prudish 
                morals. In fact, the word Puritanical, 
                coined in 1598, is a direct reflection of 
                public opinion of them.  </p>
