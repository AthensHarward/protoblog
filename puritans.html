            <p><b>Intentions</b><br>
                The purpose of these articles is to give basic 
                background information to help with the context 
                of specific events or characters. It is not 
                meant for an exhaustive study.

            <p><b>Common Stereotypes</b><br> 
                I am mostly focused on a broad, 
                bird's eye view of the movement, so I will 
                not be spending much time exploring the truth of 
                sterotypes.<br><br>
                
                Even though they existed within the Anglican 
                Church of England. The people we are talking about 
                were theologically descended from Calvinists, They 
                were further divided into two groups, the Puritans 
                and the Separatists. They were similar in many regards, 
                but their greatest difference between them was their position 
                on if the Church of England should be reformed or abandoned. 
                (2) They remained as distinct groups even in the New World. 
                <br><br> Whether or not most us are aware of the players, 
                two well known roles of these movements in history were 
                as the Pilgrims that landed at Plymouth Rock (Separatists) and 
                as the instigators of the Salem Witch Trials (Puritans). 
                As far as people's opinion of them, both past and 
                present, they were known for being extremely prudish and 
                morally strict. In fact, this is where we get the word 
                Puritanical, which references their work ethic  
                in addition to their disdain of pleasure.
