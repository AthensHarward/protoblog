            <p><b>Intentions</b><br>
                The purpose of these articles is to give basic 
                background information to help with the context 
                of specific events or characters. It is not 
                meant for an exhaustive study.

            <p><b>Common Stereotypes</b><br> 
                I am mostly focused on a broad, 
                bird's eye view of the movement, so I will 
                not be spending much time exploring the truth of 
                sterotypes.<br><br>
                
                Even though they developed within the Anglican 
                Church of England, the people we are talking about 
                were theologically descended from Calvinists. We know them as 
                the Puritans and the Separatists. They were similar to each other 
                in many regards, but their greatest difference between them was their position 
                on if the Church of England should be reformed or abandoned. (2) 
                <br><br> Whether or not most us are aware of the players, 
                two well known roles of these movements in history were 
                as the Pilgrims that landed at Plymouth Rock (Separatists) and 
                as the instigators of the Salem Witch Trials (Puritans). 
                As far as people's opinion of them, both past and 
                present, they were known for being extremely prudish and 
                morally strict. In fact, this is where we get the word 
                Puritanical, which references their work ethic  
                in addition to their austerity.

             <p><h2>Origins</h2><br>
                <b>The Protestant Reformation</b><br>
                <p>When Martin Luther published his 95 thesis in 1517, he started a series of events 
                    that ultimately led to an uprising within the Catholic Church. Trouble had already 
                    been fermenting for decades leading up to that moment. Many regarded the Roman Church 
                    as having become corrupt with the wanton selling of indulgenses being one of the 
                    major points of contention. Martin Luther just happened to be the right person at 
                    the right time to gain support from influential and powerful players in Europe that 
                    helped the movement gain a foothold.<br><br>
                    Since Luther is considered the spark that lit the Reformation blaze, he is a good starting 
                    point when looking into the origins of the Puritans. Theologically, they are not very 
                    similar to Luther, but since he started the fracture of the Church, he allowed for an 
                    environment in which disenting beliefs spread. There were many belief systems within the 
                    new movements of the Reformation. Most were already being debated within the Roman Church 
                    before the break. Now that the fear of being excumincated was no longer something to be feared, highly 
                    intelligent people with forward thinking and sometimes extremist ideas were freed to 
                    experiment. Sometimes to societies benefit...sometimes not.
