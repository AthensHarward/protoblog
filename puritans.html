            <p><b>Intentions</b><br>
                The purpose of these articles is to give basic 
                background information to help with the context 
                of specific events or characters. It is not 
                meant for an exhaustive study.

            <p><b>Common Stereotypes</b><br> 
                I am mostly focused on a broad, 
                bird's eye view of the movement, so I will 
                not be spending much time exploring the truth of 
                sterotypes.<br><br>
                
                The people we are talking about were Calvinists. They 
                were further divided into two groups, the Puritans 
                and the Separatists. They were the same people with the 
                same beliefs. What distinguished them was their position 
                on if the Church of England should 
                be reformed or abandoned. (2)<br><br> Whether or not most 
                us are aware of the players, 
                two well known roles of these Calvinists in history were 
                as the Pilgrims that landed at Plymouth Rock (Separatists) and 
                as the instigators of the Salem Witch Trials (Puritans). 
                As far as people's opinion of them, both past and 
                present, they were known for being extremely prudish and 
                morally strict. In fact, this is where we get the word 
                Puritanical, which references their work ethic  
                in addition to their disdain of pleasure.
